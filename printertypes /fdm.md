# Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM) 3D Printing

Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM) is a widely used 3D printing technology known for its accessibility and versatility. Here's a summary of FDM 3D printing!

## Process:

- FDM builds objects layer by layer by extruding thermoplastic filament through a heated nozzle.
- The filament is deposited in a controlled manner onto a build platform based on a digital 3D model.

## Materials:

- FDM supports a variety of thermoplastic materials, including PLA, ABS, PETG, and more.
- Filament choices offer a range of properties, such as strength, flexibility, and temperature resistance.

## Affordability and Accessibility:

- FDM printers are generally more affordable compared to other 3D printing technologies.
- They are widely available for personal and professional use, contributing to the popularity of FDM in maker spaces and small businesses.

## Build Volume:

- FDM printers come in various sizes, offering a range of build volumes to accommodate different project sizes.
- Larger build volumes are advantageous for creating bigger objects or multiple parts simultaneously.

## Support Structures:

- FDM printing often requires support structures for overhangs and complex geometries.
- These supports are made of the same material as the printed object and are removed after printing.

## Layer Resolution:

- FDM prints can vary in layer resolution, with smaller layer heights yielding finer details but longer print times.
- Layer resolution influences the surface finish and overall quality of the printed object.

## Applications:

- FDM is used in a wide range of applications, including prototyping, product design, educational projects, and functional parts production.
- Its versatility makes it suitable for both rapid prototyping and creating end-use parts in various industries.

## Post-Processing:

- Post-processing for FDM prints may involve smoothing surfaces, sanding, painting, or applying other finishes to achieve the desired appearance and functionality.

## Community and Open Source:

- FDM 3D printing benefits from a large and active community, contributing to the development of open-source hardware and software solutions.
- Users often share designs, tips, and troubleshooting advice.

In summary, FDM 3D printing is a cost-effective and accessible technology that finds widespread use in diverse applications. Its flexibility, combined with a broad range of available materials, makes it a popular choice for both beginners and experienced users in various industries.

## Types of FDM Printers:

### 1. Cartesian 3D Printers:

- The most common FDM printers.
- Use a Cartesian coordinate system (X, Y, and Z axes) to move the print head and build the object layer by layer.
- Simple design and widely used, making them suitable for both beginners and professionals.

### 2. Delta 3D Printers:

- Use a triangular arrangement of three arms to control the movement of the print head.
- Known for their fast and precise movements, making them suitable for certain types of prints.
- Popular for printing tall and cylindrical objects.

### 3. CoreXY 3D Printers:

- Use two stepper motors to control the movement of the print head along the X and Y axes.
- Offer fast and precise movements, similar to Delta printers.
- Often used in high-performance applications and larger print volumes.

### 4. Polar 3D Printers:

- Use a polar coordinate system, typically with a rotating build platform.
- Less common than Cartesian and Delta printers but can offer unique advantages in specific applications.
- Suitable for circular or spherical objects.

### 5. Selective Compliance Assembly Robot Arm (SCARA) Printers:

- Use a robotic arm mechanism to control the movement of the print head.
- Known for their speed and accuracy, making them suitable for certain industrial applications.
- Less common in the consumer market.

### 6. Pellet Extrusion 3D Printers:

- Instead of using filament spools, pellet extrusion printers melt plastic pellets to create the printing material.
- Can be more cost-effective for large-scale printing.
- Less common but gaining interest in industrial settings.

Each type of FDM printer has its own strengths and weaknesses, and the choice depends on factors such as the intended use, budget, and personal preferences. Understanding the differences between these types can help users select the most suitable FDM printer for their specific needs.
