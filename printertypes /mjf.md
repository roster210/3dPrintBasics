# Multi Jet Fusion (MJF) 3D Printing

Multi Jet Fusion (MJF) is an additive manufacturing technology developed by HP that utilizes a powder-based 3D printing process. Here's a summary of MJF 3D printing:

## Process

- MJF builds objects layer by layer using a powdered material, typically a nylon-based powder.
- A fusing agent is applied selectively to specific areas of the powder bed using an array of inkjet print heads.
- Heat is then applied to fuse the powdered material in the designated areas, creating solid layers.

## High Speed

- MJF is known for its high speed compared to traditional powder-based 3D printing methods like selective laser sintering (SLS).
- Simultaneous printing and fusing contribute to faster production times.

## Precision and Detail

- MJF is capable of producing detailed and precise parts with fine features and smooth surface finishes.
- It offers a high level of dimensional accuracy, making it suitable for functional prototypes and end-use parts.

## Voxel-Level Control

- MJF technology allows for voxel-level control, where each voxel (3D pixel) can be selectively addressed.
- This level of control enables the manipulation of material properties within a single layer, allowing for enhanced design possibilities.

## Powder Reusability

- Excess powder in the print bed that is not fused can be recycled and reused for subsequent prints, minimizing material waste.

## Material Variety

- While MJF is commonly associated with nylon-based materials, HP has been expanding the range of materials compatible with MJF technology, including functional and colored powders.

## Applications

- MJF is used in various industries, including automotive, aerospace, and healthcare.
- It is suitable for producing functional prototypes, end-use parts, and low to medium-volume production runs.

## Part Strength

- MJF parts often exhibit high strength and durability, making them suitable for applications where mechanical properties are crucial.

## Post-Processing

- Post-processing for MJF prints may involve removing excess powder and applying additional treatments for specific surface finishes or coloring.

In summary, Multi Jet Fusion is a fast and versatile 3D printing technology known for its speed, precision, and voxel-level control. Its ability to produce strong and detailed parts makes it suitable for a wide range of applications in various industries.
