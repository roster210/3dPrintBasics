# Marlin FW

Marlin is an open-source firmware designed for 3D printers and other similar computer numerical control (CNC) machines. It is widely used in the RepRap community and has become one of the most popular firmware choices for controlling the motion and operation of 3D printers. The name "Marlin" is a nod to the striped marlin fish, reflecting the RepRap project's tradition of naming firmware after sea creatures.

## Key Features:

- **Motion Control:** Marlin is responsible for managing the motion of the 3D printer's motors and other components. It interprets G-code commands generated by slicing software and translates them into movements, controlling the positioning and speed of the printer's various axes.

- **Compatibility:** Marlin is compatible with a wide range of 3D printer models and configurations. It supports various hardware platforms, microcontrollers, and sensors, making it a versatile choice for different setups.

- **Open Source:** Marlin is released under the GNU General Public License (GPL), making its source code freely available. This encourages collaboration, customization, and the sharing of improvements within the 3D printing community.

- **Configurability:** Users can customize Marlin to suit the specific requirements of their 3D printer. Configuration files allow for adjustments to parameters such as steps per millimeter, acceleration, jerk settings, and more.

- **Safety Features:** Marlin includes safety features designed to protect the printer and prevent potential issues. These features may include thermal runaway protection, which shuts down the printer if a temperature sensor indicates a heating element malfunction, and endstop checks to prevent crashes.

- **Auto Bed Leveling:** Marlin supports auto bed leveling, a feature that helps compensate for variations in the build surface. Probes or sensors can be used to measure the bed's surface, and the firmware adjusts the print parameters accordingly.

- **LCD Display Support:** Many 3D printers running Marlin can be equipped with LCD displays that provide an interface for controlling the printer, monitoring prints, and adjusting settings without the need for a connected computer.

- **Community Support:** Marlin benefits from an active and engaged community of users and developers. This community-driven approach contributes to ongoing development, bug fixes, and the sharing of knowledge and resources.

Overall, Marlin firmware plays a crucial role in the functionality and performance of 3D printers, providing a robust and customizable firmware solution for a wide range of hardware configurations.

## Marlin Firmware Installation Guide:

### Prerequisites:

- Before you start, make sure you have a compatible 3D printer and a working development environment on your computer (Arduino IDE, PlatformIO, etc.).

### Download Marlin Firmware:

1. Go to the Marlin Firmware GitHub repository: [Marlin Firmware GitHub](https://github.com/MarlinFirmware/Marlin)
2. Click on the "Code" button and select "Download ZIP" to download the latest version of the Marlin firmware.

### Extract the ZIP File:

Extract the downloaded ZIP file to a location on your computer.

### Open Marlin in Arduino IDE:

1. Open the Arduino IDE on your computer.
2. In the Arduino IDE, navigate to File > Open and select the Marlin.ino file from the Marlin firmware folder you extracted.

### Configure Marlin:

Before uploading, configure Marlin for your specific 3D printer. Important configurations are typically found in the Configuration.h and Configuration_adv.h files. Adjust settings such as motherboard type, thermistor types, motor steps, and more based on your printer's specifications.

### Select Board and Port:

1. In the Arduino IDE, go to Tools > Board and select the appropriate board for your printer (e.g., Arduino Mega 2560 for many RepRap-style printers).
2. Also, go to Tools > Port and select the port your printer is connected to.

### Upload Marlin Firmware:

1. Click the right-pointing arrow button (Upload) in the Arduino IDE to compile and upload the Marlin firmware to your 3D printer's control board.
2. Monitor the progress in the bottom console of the Arduino IDE. Once the upload is complete, the firmware is installed on your printer.

### Verify Installation:

- Power on your 3D printer and check if the new Marlin firmware is functioning correctly.
- Use the printer's interface or LCD screen to navigate and verify that settings match your configurations.
