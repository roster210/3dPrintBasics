# Klipper Firmware

Klipper is an open-source firmware designed for 3D printers, taking a unique approach by offloading complex calculations to a single-board computer (SBC), such as a Raspberry Pi. This allows for improved performance, easy configuration, and support for various printers. Here's an overview of its key features and a guide on how to install Klipper firmware:

## Key Features:

- **Offloaded Processing:**
  - Klipper offloads computation-intensive tasks to an SBC, enabling complex calculations, improved accuracy, and faster processing.
  
- **Improved Performance:**
  - With high-level computations handled by the SBC, Klipper achieves better performance, benefiting printers with complex movements and high-resolution requirements.

- **Easy Configuration:**
  - Klipper uses a human-readable configuration file, making it easier to configure compared to other firmware, allowing users to customize it to their specific printer.

- **Support for Various Printers:**
  - Compatible with a wide range of 3D printers, supporting various microcontrollers and SBCs.

- **OctoPrint Integration:**
  - Often used with OctoPrint for a seamless and feature-rich printing experience.

- **Dynamic Acceleration:**
  - Introduces dynamic acceleration adjustment during printing for smoother movements and potentially faster print times.

- **PID Tuning:**
  - Includes a sophisticated PID tuning algorithm for temperature control, ensuring stable and accurate temperatures for the hotend and heated bed.

- **Extensive Documentation:**
  - Comprehensive documentation covering installation, configuration, and advanced features, providing a valuable resource for users and developers.

- **Active Community:**
  - A dedicated and active community of users and developers contributing to ongoing development, providing support through forums and Discord.

## Klipper Firmware Installation Guide:

### Prerequisites:

- A 3D printer with a compatible microcontroller and an SBC (Raspberry Pi, OctoPrint setup, etc.).
- A working development environment on your computer, including SSH access to the SBC.

### Installation Steps:

1. **Connect SBC to 3D Printer:**
   - Connect the SBC to your 3D printer, ensuring a proper connection.

2. **Install Klipper on SBC:**
   - Connect to your SBC via SSH.
   - Run the following commands to install Klipper:
     ```bash
     mkdir ~/klipper
     cd ~/klipper
     git clone https://github.com/Klipper3d/klipper.git
     ```

3. **Configure Klipper:**
   - Navigate to the Klipper directory and edit the printer configuration file to match your printer's specifications.
     ```bash
     nano ~/klipper/printer.cfg
     ```

4. **Install Klipper Firmware on Microcontroller:**
   - Build and install Klipper on your microcontroller:
     ```bash
     make menuconfig  # Optional - configure additional settings
     make
     make flash
     ```

5. **Update Firmware on SBC:**
   - If using a Raspberry Pi, follow Klipper documentation to set up and update the firmware on the SBC.

6. **Restart 3D Printer:**
   - Once the firmware is flashed, restart your 3D printer. Klipper should now be running.

7. **Verify Installation:**
   - Connect to the printer via OctoPrint or other interfaces to verify that Klipper is working. You should see the Klipper status and be able to control the printer.
