## Prusa Printers

**Summary:**
Prusa Research, founded by Josef Prusa, is known for its high-quality and reliable 3D printers. The flagship product is the Original Prusa i3 series, with models like the Prusa i3 MK3S+. Prusa printers are renowned for their open-source nature, user-friendly design, and continuous improvements.

## Prusa Firmware

**Summary:**
Prusa printers typically use the Marlin firmware, an open-source firmware widely adopted in the 3D printing community. The Marlin firmware provides control over the printer's movements, temperature, and other essential functions. Prusa regularly contributes to Marlin's development and provides firmware updates to enhance printer performance.

## Official Support

**Summary:**
Prusa Research offers excellent official support for its products. This includes comprehensive documentation, troubleshooting guides, and a dedicated customer support team. Users can access the Prusa Knowledge Base and community forums for assistance. Prusa also actively engages with its user community through regular firmware updates and feature improvements.

## PrusaOwners

**Summary:**
PrusaOwners is an independent community forum for Prusa printer users. It serves as a valuable resource where Prusa enthusiasts share knowledge, experiences, and support. While not officially affiliated with Prusa Research, PrusaOwners has become a significant hub for discussions on modifications, troubleshooting, and showcasing prints within the Prusa community. You can find information on prusa3d forums, but I strongly recommend checking out the separate information found on the community GitHub. I personally think that the prusa forums are too centralized on the idea that the printer is a perfect piece of hardware created by a god, Josef Prusa, whose animated picture of his face is sent with every printer as a sticker, allowing you to stick it and worship it anywhere, if you so please. Although he is great for 3D printing, there are and have been many more who introduced a lot to this world.
