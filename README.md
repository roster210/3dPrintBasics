# 3D Printing Repository

Welcome to the 3D Printing Repository! This repository serves as a comprehensive guide for individuals looking to explore the world of 3D printing. Here, you'll find information on different types of printers, along with links and details about the popular firmwares that power them today.

## Introduction

This repository is designed for the average person who wants to gain knowledge and background on 3D printing. Whether you're considering purchasing a 3D printer for personal or business use, or if you're just intrigued by additive manufacturing, this repository aims to provide you with a decent understanding of the fascinating world of 3D printing.

### Choosing the Right Printer

For personal printing, we strongly recommend Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM) technology. It's user-friendly, versatile, and ideal for beginners. If you're feeling adventurous, you may explore Stereolithography (SLA), although the content here will primarily offer a summary due to its more advanced nature.

Remember, 3D printing is not just a technologyâ€”it's cool, and knowing about it makes you cool too! Don't you want to be cool? Being cool is super cool.
**caution: some printers print very very hot so keep safe and stay cool.
