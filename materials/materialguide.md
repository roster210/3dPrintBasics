# FDM Materials Guide

## 1. PLA (Polylactic Acid):

**Applications:**
- Prototyping, hobbyist projects, decorative prints, and low-stress functional parts.

**Usage Tips:**
- Easy to print with low nozzle temperatures.
- Suitable for beginners.

**Recommended Nozzle:**
- Standard brass nozzle.

## 2. ABS (Acrylonitrile Butadiene Styrene):

**Applications:**
- Functional prototypes, automotive parts, and items requiring strength and durability.

**Usage Tips:**
- Requires a heated bed to minimize warping.
- Print in a well-ventilated area due to fumes.

**Recommended Nozzle:**
- Hardened steel or wear-resistant nozzle.

## 3. PETG (Polyethylene Terephthalate Glycol):

**Applications:**
- Mechanical parts, containers, and objects requiring strength and flexibility.

**Usage Tips:**
- Print at a slightly higher temperature than PLA.
- Good layer adhesion and minimal warping.

**Recommended Nozzle:**
- Standard brass nozzle.

## 4. TPU (Thermoplastic Polyurethane):

**Applications:**
- Flexible and elastic parts, such as phone cases, shoe insoles, and seals.

**Usage Tips:**
- Print slow to avoid extruder skipping.
- Use a direct drive extruder for better results.

**Recommended Nozzle:**
- Larger diameter brass or hardened steel nozzle.

## 5. Nylon:

**Applications:**
- Gears, bearings, and other high-wear components.

**Usage Tips:**
- Requires a dry environment as it absorbs moisture.
- Print on a heated bed.

**Recommended Nozzle:**
- Hardened steel or wear-resistant nozzle.

## 6. Woodfill PLA:

**Applications:**
- Decorative prints, artistic projects.

**Usage Tips:**
- Print with a larger nozzle for a wood-like texture.
- Sandable and stainable.

**Recommended Nozzle:**
- Standard brass nozzle.

## 7. Metal-Infused Filaments (e.g., BrassFill, CopperFill):

**Applications:**
- Artistic prints, sculptures, and items requiring a metallic finish.

**Usage Tips:**
- Use a wear-resistant nozzle.
- Post-processing (polishing) enhances metallic appearance.

**Recommended Nozzle:**
- Hardened steel or wear-resistant nozzle.

## 8. Carbon Fiber PETG:

**Applications:**
- Lightweight, high-strength components.

**Usage Tips:**
- Abrasive; use a hardened steel nozzle.
- High-temperature resistance.

**Recommended Nozzle:**
- Hardened steel or wear-resistant nozzle.

### Important Considerations:

- **Printer Compatibility:**
  - Ensure your printer can handle the filament type and its specific requirements (heated bed, enclosure, etc.).

- **Enclosure:**
  - Some materials benefit from printing in an enclosed environment to minimize warping and improve layer adhesion.

- **Post-Processing:**
  - Consider post-processing techniques such as sanding, painting, or chemical treatments to enhance the final appearance of your prints.

- **Safety:**
  - Be aware of fumes emitted during printing, especially with materials like ABS. Print in well-ventilated areas or use an enclosure with a ventilation system.

Remember to consult your printer's manual and material specifications for compatibility and optimal printing settings. Additionally, choose a nozzle type based on the specific material's properties to achieve the best results.
